Building from Source
====================

This project supports building from source on Windows using CMake and Visual
Studio Build Tools.

Requirements
------------

Visual Studio Build Tools 2022: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is done by modifying src/config.hpp as desired and (re)compiling.

Build instructions
------------------

* Open x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022
* Build the project:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles"
    nmake

* The resulting executable (wndwalk.exe) will be located in the build directory.


Troubleshooting
===============

* Make sure you are using the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt — not the x86 or
  generic command prompt.
